# l9-meta-injector CHANGELOG

## 3.0.0 - 2026-07-22

### Breaking

- Replaced the broad root barrel with an orchestration-first stable root.
- Added stable `./inventory` and `./schema` entrypoints.
- Added experimental `./advanced` and `./advanced/llm` entrypoints.
- Denied unlisted deep imports through an explicit package export map.

### Assurance

- Added separate runtime and declaration export inventories.
- Added source, package-map, installed-tarball, declaration, and deep-import validation.
- Added a publication decision gate so unresolved package history blocks publishing without blocking implementation or CI.

### Migration

- Added `docs/migrations/v2-to-v3.md` with import mappings.

## 2.1.0 - 2026-06-19

Introduced the TypeScript metadata injection pipeline, LLM-assisted prose reconciliation, namespace handling, filename normalization, and body-preserving verification.
